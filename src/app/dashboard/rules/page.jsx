            Effective learning environments require an atmosphere of trust and
            respect for the intellectual property rights of educators and fellow
            learners. To ensure the integrity and confidentiality of class
            materials, Kingship Technologies has implemented the following
            policy prohibiting the recording of class materials.
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Prohibition on Recording: Recording, in any form or medium, of
            class lectures, presentations, discussions, or any other class
            materials is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited
            to, audio recording, video recording, screen capture, and
            photography.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Intellectual Property Rights: The class materials provided by
            instructors are protected by copyright and other intellectual
            property laws. The unauthorized recording, reproduction, or
            distribution of class materials infringes upon these rights and is
            strictly prohibited.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. Confidentiality and Privacy: The class materials discussed and
            presented during class may contain sensitive, confidential, or
            personal information. Maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of
            this information is crucial. Recording class materials without
            proper authorization increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure
            or misuse of this information and is strictly prohibited.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. Enforcement and Consequences: Violation of this policy may result
            in disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to,
            class penalties, loss of access to class materials, and other
            appropriate measures as determined by the Instructors at Kingship
            Technologies. In addition, legal action may be pursued to protect
            the intellectual property rights of the instructors and the school.
            <br />
            <br />
            5. Acknowledgment: By participating in our courses, all students
            acknowledge and agree to comply with this policy regarding the
            prohibition on recording class materials. We believe that adhering

            integrity. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this
            policy, please contact Kindship Technologies administration for
            further clarification.

            At Kingship Technologies we are committed to promoting ethical
            conduct, responsible use of technology, and maintaining a safe and
            secure learning environment. To ensure the appropriate use of class

            policy prohibits the use of class materials for hacking or any
            unauthorized activities:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Prohibition on Hacking and Unauthorized Activities: Students are
            strictly prohibited from using any class materials, knowledge, or
            resources obtained during their coursework for engaging in hacking,
            unauthorized access, or any illegal activities. This includes, but
            is not limited to, attempting to gain unauthorized access to
            computer systems, networks, or personal accounts; distributing
            malware or malicious software; and any activities that compromise
            the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information
            systems.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Ethical Use of Knowledge: Students are expected to apply the
            knowledge gained from class materials in an ethical and responsible
            manner. It is essential to respect the privacy and security of
            others, comply with applicable laws and regulations, and adhere to
            the code of conduct and acceptable use policies.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. Awareness and Education: Kingship technologies will strive to
            create awareness and provide education regarding the responsible use
            of technology, cybersecurity best practices, and the potential
            consequences of hacking or unauthorized activities. This may include
            training sessions, or incorporating relevant topics into the
            curriculum to ensure students understand the importance of ethical
            behavior.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. Compliance with Laws and Regulations: All students must comply
            with applicable local, national, and international laws,
            regulations, and policies related to computer security, hacking, and
            unauthorized activities. Any violation of these laws or regulations
            will be treated seriously and may result in legal consequences at
            the state level.
